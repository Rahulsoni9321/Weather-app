# Weather App

I am excited to present my Weather App, a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides real-time weather information for different cities, including details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, offering a seamless experience for users to access weather updates.
